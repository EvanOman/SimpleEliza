## Conversation 1
```
[eliza]Hello, I am your academic advisor Eliza. What is your name?
[user1]Hello, my name is Evan
[eliza]Nice to meet you Evan, what is your major?
[user1]I am majoring in Mathematics
[eliza]I have always been interested in Mathematics, do you like it so far?
[user1]Yes I am loving it. But can I ask you a question?
[eliza]How can I help you today?
[user1]How many credits do I need to graduate?
[eliza]How many credits do you think you need to graduate?
[user1]I am not sure
[eliza]Evan, I am concerned that you do not know much about your graduation plan. If you want to succeed at Mathematics you must pay attention to the details.
[user1]I am trying
[eliza]Why do you say you are trying?
[user1]Well I am supposed to graduate, though I don't think I will.
[eliza]You sound discouraged. Mathematics is hard work but I think you can do it!
[user1]Thank you. But seriously, how many credits do I need to graduate?
[eliza]Have you tried this wonderful resource called Google?
[user1]No. Well I mean I tried but then I got frustrated.
[eliza]No need to get emotional, we will figure this out!
[user1]You are not helpful
[eliza]Why do you say I am not helpful?
[user1]Your responses are very vague
[eliza]Tell me more.
[user1]Your responses don't have any relevant info
[eliza]Tell me more.
[user1]I'd rather not
[eliza]Let's change the subject, is there anything else I can help you with?
[user1]Sure, can I ask you a new question?
[eliza]How can I help you today?
[user1]What do I need to take this semester?
[eliza]What do you think you need to take this semester?
[user1]I am thinking more math classes?
[eliza]Why do you say you are thinking more math classes??
[user1]Because I am getting a math degree
[eliza]Tell me more.
[user1]I thought my academic advisor would know more about this
[eliza]Why do you say you thought your academic advisor would know more about this?
[user1]I thought this was your job
[eliza]Why do you say you thought this was my job?
[user1]Exit
[eliza]Good bye, Evan, I hope you do well in Mathematics.

[eliza]Hello, I am your academic advisor Eliza. What is your name?

[user2]Well we weave baskets underwater, I think that is pretty cool
[eliza]Tell me more.
[user2]That is about it
[eliza]Let's change the subject, is there anything else I can help you with?
[user2]Can I ask you a new question?
[eliza]How can I help you today?
[user2]What is the purpose of all of the required math classes?
[eliza]What do you think is the purpose of all of the required math classes?
[user2]To punish people in other majors
[eliza]Tell me more.
[user2]I just get so frustrated in all of my math classes
[eliza]No need to get emotional, we will figure this out!
[user2]Thanks. I just don't think I will graduate with all of these math requirements.
[eliza]You sound discouraged. Underwater Basket Weaving is hard work but I think you can do it!
[user2]I am not worried about the basket weaving, it is the math classes I need to worry about
[eliza]Why do you say you are not worried about the basket weaving, it is the math classes you need to worry about?
[user2]Because I can weave baskets no problem
[eliza]Tell me more.
[user2]I have always had a penchant for such things
[eliza]Why do you say you have always had a penchant for such things?
[user2]Because I am a boss. But I am afraid I don't know how many more math classes I need
[eliza]Have you tried this wonderful resource called Google?
[user2]What is the number of math classes that I still need to take?
[eliza]What do you think is the number of math classes that you still need to take
[user2]I don't know
[eliza]Geoff, I am concerned that you do not know much about your graduation plan. If you want to succeed at Underwater Basket Weaving you must pay attention to the details.
[user2]I am sorry
[eliza]Why do you say you are sorry?
[user2]Because I am confused and shouldn't be
[eliza]Tell me more.
[user2]I don't want to
[eliza]You sound discouraged. Underwater Basket Weaving is hard work but I think you can do it!
