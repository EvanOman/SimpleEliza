# Simple Eliza

This is a Perl implementation of the simple Eliza chatbot. Below are some logs from two conversations:

> [user]I am thinking more math classes?
> [eliza]Why do you say you are thinking more math classes??
> [user]Because I am getting a math degree
> [eliza]Tell me more.
> [user]I thought my academic advisor would know more about this

> [eliza]Tell me more.
> [user]I have always had a penchant for such things
> [eliza]Why do you say you have always had a penchant for such things?
> [user]Because I am a boss. But I am afraid I don't know how many more math classes I need
> [eliza]Have you tried this wonderful resource called Google?
> [user]What is the number of math classes that I still need to take?
> [eliza]What do you think is the number of math classes that you still need to take
> [user]I don't know
